Notifications
=============

Similarly to other OpenStack services Fenix emits notifications to the message
bus with the Notifier class provided by oslo.messaging [1]_. From the
notification consumer point of view a notification consists of two parts:
an envelope with a fixed structure defined by oslo.messaging and a payload
defined by the service emitting the notification. The envelope format
is the following:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "priority": "string, selected from a predefined list by the sender",
        "event_type": "string, defined by the sender",
        "timestamp": "string, the isotime of when the notification emitted",
        "publisher_id": "string, defined by the sender",
        "message_id": "uuid, generated by oslo",
        "payload": "json serialized dict, defined by the sender"
    }


Admin
=====

These notifications are meant for admin level user. infrastructure admin who is
in charge of triggering the rolling maintenance and upgrade workflows and for
any infrastructure service needing to know about the host being in maintenance.
This might be used for enabling/disabling self-healing or billing.


Even type 'maintenance.host'
----------------------------

This event type is meant for infrastructure services to know the host might be
down and taken out of normal usage. Also after the host is back or new host
added, there is another message to tell host is back in use or added. This might
be meaningful for self-healing or billing.

| service    | string | Origin service name: Fenix                                                   |
+------------+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| state      | string | Maintenance state. values can be 'IN_MAINTENANCE' or 'MAINTENANCE_COMPLETE'. |
|            |        | In future this might have also values like 'HOST_ADDED' or 'HOST_REMOVED'.   |
+------------+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| session_id | string | UUID of the related maintenance session                                      |
+------------+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| host       | string | Host name                                                                    |
+------------+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| project_id | string | workflow admin project ID                                                    |
+------------+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "service": "fenix",
        "state": "IN_MAINTENANCE",
        "session_id": "76e55df8-1c51-11e8-9928-0242ac110002",
        "host": "overcloud-novacompute-0.opnfvlf.org",
        "project_id": "ead0dbcaf3564cbbb04842e3e54960e3"
    }


Even type 'maintenance.session'
-------------------------------

--Not yet implemented--

This event type is meant for infrastructure admin to know the changes in the
ongoing maintenance workflow session. When implemented, there will not be a need
for polling the state through an API.


Project
=======

These notifications are meant for a project level user to know about
a maintenance session affecting its instances.

Project/application manager (VNFM) can have a 'POST /maintenance' API to catch
notification through an AODH event alarm [2]_.


Even type 'maintenance.planned'
-------------------------------

This event type is meant for a project level user to know about
a maintenance session state affecting its instances. According to this event
project manager (VNFM) can know to make actions to its instances affected by
maintenance and replying back to Fenix.

|                 |            | maintained host. As knowing these capabilities, the project-manager    |
|                 |            | can plan its own upgrade at the same time or later. This will be handy |
|                 |            | to even re-instantiate instances with a new flavor to take a new type  |
|                 |            | of hardware into use.                                                  |
